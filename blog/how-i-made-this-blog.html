    <p>Every now and then, I get asked how I made this blog from a technical standpoint. In this
post, I want to share how my content is generated and hosted, and then describe some commonly-used,
alternative approaches that I decided not to take.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>I write each post in a separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> file.
Markdown is nice because it’s super lightweight, supports most of the formatting I need
(headers, bolding, bullets, etc.), and I’ve used it a lot for writing documentation at work, so
I feel very comfortable with the syntax.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a sample of the Markdown for my recent post on
<a href="/blog/quitting-a-new-job">quitting a new job</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">post</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span>  <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Quitting</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">a</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">new</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">job"</span>
<span class="na">date</span><span class="pi">:</span>   <span class="s">2021-01-01 18:40:00 -0700</span>
<span class="na">categories</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">career</span>
<span class="na">excerpt</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">Two years ago, I did something ...</span>
<span class="s">---</span>

Two years ago, I did something that I'd never done in my career before-
I left a job (at <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">Nuro</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://nuro.ai</span><span class="p">)</span>) only a few months after starting
it. In this post, I want to explain what happened and what I learned from
the experience.

<span class="gu">## What happened</span>

<span class="gu">#### The job switch</span>

Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">Stripe</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="sx">https://www.stripe.com</span><span class="p">)</span>,
where I'd been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full
details are best left to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very
happy...</code></pre></figure>

<p>I then use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to convert these Markdown files into a collection
of static HTML pages that can be rendered by web browsers. Jekyll is what’s known as a
“static site generator”; in addition to supporting higher-level formats like Markdown that are
easier to work with than HTML, these frameworks also automate setting the look-and-feel of each
page and inserting common content like headers and footers that would be tedious to add manually.</p>

<p>Here’s what the <a href="/blog/quitting-a-new-job">quitting a new job</a> Markdown looks like after
conversion to HTML:</p>

<p>Finally, I push the generated HTML files, along with a stylesheet for the site, into the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch of my <a href="https://github.com/yolken/yolken-blog">GitHub repo</a>. GitHub has a nice
feature called <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> that will take the contents of an arbitrary
branch (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> by default) and serve them as static content behind a web server. It also
supports custom domains, which allows for my pages to be available though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yolken.net</code> as opposed to
a shared domain like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">github.com</code>.</p>

<p>GitHub has solid documentation on the entire process, including the content generation
steps, that you can read
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">here</a>. Everything is free if your repo is open-source
and you abide by the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages">GitHub Pages guidelines</a>, all of which
are pretty reasonable for most personal blogs.</p>

<h2 id="rejected-alternatives">Rejected alternatives</h2>

<p>There are several other approaches to publishing a blog online that I decided not to go with.
These weren’t ideal for me, but, depending on your specific requirements, may be reasonable
choices for your content.</p>

<h3 id="use-a-third-party-blogging-service">Use a third-party blogging service</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get a blog online is to use a third-party, hosted blogging service.
Back in the day, <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> was all the rage.
Now, it seems like <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is the hot platform to use. There are tons of other
choices here, including social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, which have started supporting
blog-like user content.</p>

<p>The main advantage of these services is that they’re super easy-to-use. You just type up your
content in a pretty, web-based editor and click a button to publish. They also provide features like
comments, searching, and subscriptions on top of your content without much effort.</p>

<p>The downside of these services is that you’re handing over your content to a third-party,
who’s packaging it up with other people’s content, applying their own look-and-feel, and, in many
cases, trying to monetize it. Even though you’re the author, and even though you maintain
legal rights to your content in most cases, there’s a tendency for your work to become associated
more with the hosting service than with you.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m fine with this when I’m sharing low-quality, short-form content like
my vacation photos. However, for something as important and personal as my blog, I wanted
to be in complete control and not share any ownership with a third-party.</p>

<p>If you’re just writing occasionally, though, or really, really don’t want to deal with any
technical details, putting your content in a third-party service might be an acceptable
choice.</p>

<h3 id="host-in-a-cloud-provider">Host in a cloud provider</h3>

<p>GitHub Pages is very reliable and low-hassle but only handles static content and imposes
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages">some limitations</a> on this content including its size and
update frequency. It also abstracts away the lower-level serving details, which are
sometimes useful to observe and adjust.</p>

<p>An alternative is to host your blog using a cloud provider like AWS. The details
here vary a lot based on which provider you’re using and what you’re trying to do, but if
you have static content only, you can use a storage service like
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> plus a content delivery network (CDN) like
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> to handle caching and HTTPS termination closer
to end users.</p>

<p>I decided to not take this approach because my blog comfortably fits within the limits of
GitHub Pages, and I also like that it’s totally free. This may change in the future, though, if I
outgrow GitHub Pages or get bored and want to handle more of the lower-level serving details
myself.</p>

<h3 id="run-your-own-content-management-system-cms">Run your own content management system (CMS)</h3>

<p>Static sites like the one for this blog are fairly limited; among other examples, you can’t
customize pages on a per-user basis, it’s hard to provide dynamic features like search,
and, since all posts are static files, it can become tedious to manage a large amount of content.</p>

<p>An alternative is to run a service called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system (CMS)</a>, which
stores the content in a database and dynamically generates pages in response to user requests.
Because the content is stored in a structured format and because the server can customize the
contents of each page, it’s much easier to incorporate Blogger or Medium-like features such as user
logins, search, and online post editing.</p>

<p>There are a large number of fully-featured, open-source CMSes to choose from, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>. You can also write your own on top of a web
application framework like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.</p>

<p>Running these systems is a lot more complicated than throwing static HTML into
GitHub Pages or S3. In addition to choosing a hosting provider and configuring all of the
associated software, you also need to worry about things like monitoring (what if the site goes
down?) and capacity planning (what if a post goes viral and gets tens of thousands of views?).</p>

<p>For me, the extra features of a CMS just weren’t worth the hassle. However, this may be a good
choice if you want to create a site with more than just a static list of posts. The more popular
CMSes like WordPress also have rich ecosystems of themes and plugins that you can use
to create prettier, more complex online destinations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This blog consists of static HTML served by GitHub Pages. Although it’s not the fanciest
approach, I’ve found that it provides a high degree of personal control while having
minimal maintenance overhead.</p>
