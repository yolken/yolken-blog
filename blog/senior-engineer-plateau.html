    <p>For several years of my career, I was stuck at the “senior engineer” level, and this made me
feel frustrated and stuck at the associated jobs.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to explain how this “plateau” happened, why it frustrated me, and
some general tips for navigating out of it.</p>

<h2 id="aside-the-senior-engineer-level">Aside: The senior engineer level</h2>

<p>As described in <a href="/blog/stop-hiding-levels">my earlier blog post</a>, most
companies beyond a small size have well-defined career ladders for software engineers, with at
least 4 levels. The details vary from company to company, but in most of these ladders the
“senior” level is what employees get to after 5+ years of industry experience.</p>

<p>At most places, this rung on the latter is also considered the “career level”, which implies a few
things. First, this means that once you get to it, you can stay in it forever- as long as you meet
expectations, you can spend 30+ years as a senior engineer, and no one will ever complain about
your lack of ambition or try to push you out for not advancing further.</p>

<p>Second, as the “career level”, it means that people’s careers naturally flow into it. Assuming
the correct mentorship, management, project work, etc., most company promotion processes don’t
put up lots of barriers for people getting to “senior” and, moreover, might even require them to do
this after a certain number of years at the company.</p>

<p>Once you get to senior, however, the path beyond it can be much harder. Because staff and higher
roles can come with significantly more compensation (discussed below) and because not everyone
is expected to get up to these levels, companies are much, much pickier about how and why they
promote people into them.</p>

<h2 id="my-level-history">My level history</h2>

<p>I started my engineering career at MoPub, which, as a small startup, didn’t have formal
levels for individual contributors (ICs). When we were acquired by Twitter, I was slotted at
the staff level, which was great and happened for various reasons that I describe more below.</p>

<p>For my next two jobs, at Airbnb and Stripe, I was back at the senior level. At both places, but
particularly at Stripe (since that happened later in my career after I had accumulated more
experience), I felt a bit stuck and frustrated at the difficulty in advancing.</p>

<p>In my most recent job at Segment, I’m back up at the staff level and on a path for further
advancement (I hope!), which has made me happier.</p>

<h2 id="why-level-matters">Why level matters</h2>

<p>A common statement I hear is that “levels don’t matter” and thus that you shouldn’t care whether
you’re stuck at senior or somewhere else on the ladder for a long time.</p>

<p>While this is true from a strictly title-based standpoint (personally, I really don’t care whether
my LinkedIn profile says “software engineer” as opposed to “staff software engineer” or something
else), the reality is that levels are more than just words.</p>

<p>First, they’re an acknowledgement of the work that you’ve done. Like most engineers,
I’m motivated by working on things that matter, and levels are one way (but certainly not the only
way) to express that your work is valued and has had a positive impact at the company.</p>

<p>Second, and probably more importantly for many, levels play a big role in compensation. As
described in <a href="/blog/stop-hiding-levels">my earlier blog post</a>, each level has associated salary and
equity bands. Once you hit the upper end of the band, which may happen relatively quickly if you
negotiated well for your initial offer, it’s hard to get significant increases from year-to-year.</p>

<p>There are a few other ways, beyond pay bands, that levels affect compensation. At some companies
significant equity increases are tied to promotion. If you don’t get promoted, you might not get
stock refreshers frequently. Also, at companies with bonus programs, the target is often tied
to level. At Stripe, for instance, senior engineers had a target of 10% of base salary
whereas staff had a 20% one. This meant that, all else being equal, staff engineers would get
significantly larger bonuses. Google also had level-specific targets when I was there.</p>

<h2 id="frustrations">Frustrations</h2>

<h4 id="productivity-alone-is-not-sufficient">Productivity alone is not sufficient</h4>

<p>I consider my productivity to be one of my greatest strengths as an engineer. I just like getting
stuff done, writing code, fixing bugs, etc. and care less about all of the overhead around
promoting my projects, meeting with users, navigating around bureaucracy, and so forth.</p>

<p>At both Airbnb and Stripe, I felt that I was super productive from a code generation standpoint,
but when it came time to do calibration and make promotion decisions, it didn’t really matter
that much. The evaluators were looking for more general impact, and productivity was just one
among many other data points.</p>

<p>Personally, I found that frustrating not only because it didn’t align optimally with my strengths
but also because it seems like code <em>should be</em> the primary criterion for evaluating software
engineers. Software engineers are hired to write software just as doctors are hired to treat
patients and artists are hired to make art. If I’m comparing two engineers or two doctors or two
artists and one produces twice as much output as the other at equivalent quality, I feel like the
more productive one should be at a level that pays twice as much. But, alas, that’s not how the
world works, whether in software or in other professions.</p>

<h4 id="breadth-over-depth">Breadth over depth</h4>

<p>A related frustration I’ve had with getting to staff level at large companies is that the
promotion criteria place a bigger emphasis on breadth as opposed to depth. You can be an expert
in a technical field and do great work there, but if you don’t also check off other boxes
(e.g., cross-team coordination, mentorship, etc.), then you’ll likely hit roadblocks in getting
to the next level.</p>

<p>Thus, the system tends to reward people whose work is “horizontal”, i.e. spread across multiple
projects, domains, and types of work as opposed to those who are more “vertically” focused
on a specific thing. This isn’t necessarily wrong (horizontal work can have a big, positive impact
on a company and should be rewarded as such), but it is something to be aware of and is something
that can cause some frustration if, like me, you’re more about depth than breadth.</p>

<h4 id="visibility-required">Visibility required</h4>

<p>For promotion to senior and lower levels, the direct manager’s word is usually enough- if the
manager says that one of their reports is ready for the next level, and there’s some basic peer
validation, then the person will most likely get promoted.</p>

<p>For staff and higher levels, though, the manager’s word is typically not enough. The person up for
promotion could be the greatest engineer in the world, but if no one outside of their immediate
team can affirm this, then they’re unlikely to get to the next level.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get this affirmation is to be <em>visible</em> to those outside of your team and
particularly to those who are making the promotion decision. Unfortunately, though, this can be
hard if you’re super introverted (as I am), or you’re working head’s down on a deep technical
problem that isn’t flashy and doesn’t naturally lend itself to cross-company visibility.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-it">How to fix it</h2>

<h4 id="find-the-right-role">Find the right role</h4>

<p>This might come across as a bit extreme, but if you really care about career advancement then
the most important thing is to find a company and a role where the work and evaluation criteria
match your strengths. As mentioned above, I feel that I’m strongest on the productivity side
and less good at the “cross team coordination”, “high-level architecture leadership”, and other
dimensions that high-level ICs are promoted for. Other people, however, might excel at the latter
and not want to spend all day pumping out pull requests.</p>

<p>I don’t have a ton of data to validate this, and this is probably an overly broad generalization,
but in my experience it seems like smaller companies value productivity / “getting things done” more
whereas larger companies place less emphasis on this and more on the other, “broad impact”
traits. I think that’s why I’ve had more career success at MoPub and Segment as opposed to
the larger employers I was at in between.</p>

<p>Independent of company size, the details will vary a lot from place to place, so it’s important
to assess your strengths, understand what level you’re coming in at, and evaluate how easy or
hard it will be to advance <em>before</em> you sign a job offer.</p>

<h4 id="make-sure-you-check-the-boxes">Make sure you check the boxes</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, many companies evaluate employees on a broad set of criteria and require
positive signal in all of them before allowing a promotion. Thus, if you’re trying to advance
it’s really important that you “check off all the boxes”, even if some of these aren’t fun or
aligned to your strengths. So, for instance, if getting to staff requires “mentorship experience”,
then it’s important that you have some opportunity to do this, e.g. by hosting an intern for the
summer.</p>

<p>You should consult your company’s career ladder documentation and work closely with your direct
manager to figure out what these boxes are and how you can fill out the missing pieces.</p>

<h4 id="improve-your-visibility">Improve your visibility</h4>

<p>Getting more visibility for yourself and your work is really key for advancing to higher
levels. Even if you’re introverted and even if it’s uncomfortable, you need to ensure that
the people evaluating your work understand what you’re doing and why it’s important.</p>

<p>In some cases, for instance if you’re at a really small company or working on a flashy,
high-visibility product in a larger company, the visibility comes for free. In other cases,
though, you need to do extra work to get this. Some tips here include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do regular “skip level” 1:1s with your manager’s manager; if they don’t understand your work
  and aren’t promoting you to others, then it’s going to be hard to get ahead.</li>
  <li>Send out progress reports, launch announcements, etc. so others beyond your immediate team
  know what you and your colleagues are working on.</li>
  <li>Write blog posts, present at conferences, do internal “tech talks”, and participate in other
  activities that allow you to build your personal brand and promote your work.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>At many companies, the senior engineer level is easy to get into but hard to advance beyond.
I personally felt “stuck” at senior earlier in my career, and it seems that this is not
an uncommon experience among software engineers.</p>

<p>The key thing is to realize how the system works and ensure that where you’re working and what
you’re working on is aligned with your long-term career goals. Once you achieve this alignment,
advancing can still be slow but at least there’s a clear, achievable path to follow.</p>
