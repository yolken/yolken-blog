      </h3>Over the last few years, I've worked on
migrations at several companies- Airbnb, Stripe, and Segment (my current employer). In this
post, I want to talk about why these migrations are done, what they involve, and why they can
be hard.

      </h3>Software engineers are an interesting bunch. While quirks are fine, and I have a few myself,
there are certain traits I've encountered that are genuinely counterproductive to my team's
work. In this post, I want to explain what these are and how I try to deal with people who
exhibit them.

      </h3>The go standard library is fairly rich. However, there are certain pieces of functionality
that are either missing or insufficient and that, as a result, require the use of
third-party libraries in nearly all of my projects. In this post, I want to go through the
main "batteries not included" in the standard library, and the alternatives that I typically
use for each one.

how companies can make their onboarding processes better.

what happened and what I learned from the experience.

I decided to leave academia after graduation. At the time, I explored several career choices
but ultimately decided to take a Product Manager job at Google. In this post, I want to discuss
why I think tech is a great destination for people with technical PhDs.

      </h3>Many software engineering interview loops include an "architecture interview", where the
candidate is asked to develop a high-level design for a software system. Over the last few
years, I've given many, many of these interviews. Based on these experiences, I'd like to share
what it takes to succeed in them, and some common behaviors to avoid.

      </h3>Since I switched into engineering 8 years ago, I've witnessed a few productivity and
organization tools that have really been "transformative" in terms of how I do my day-to-day
work. In this post, I want to share my personal, before-and-after experiences with these.

      </h3>Over the course of my tech career thus far, I've been through two acquisitions. In each case,
I was just a normal employee without any special inside knowledge, and found out only a few days
before the deals were publicly announced. In retrospect, however, there were some clear signs
in the weeks leading up to the announcements that something unusual was going on.

      </h3>Equity in one's employer is a large part of the compensation for Software Engineers.
In this post, I want to describe how the different kinds of equity work and why I strongly
prefer one type, restricted stock units (RSUs), over options-based alternatives.

          Stop hiding levels
        </a>
      </h3>Most tech companies, even those without formal job titles,
assign "levels" to engineers. Despite the importance of levels for determining compensation
and job expectations, many companies prevent non-management employees
from seeing anyone's levels besides their own. In this post,
I explain why this is a harmful practice that should be
discontinued.

      </h3>Over the course of my career, I've had many jobs which implies that I've also left many jobs.
Leaving a job can be awkward and emotionally draining, but, depending on the circumstances,
also liberating and life-improving. In this post, I want to provide some guidance on why, how,
