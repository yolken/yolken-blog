          Six years of recruiting emails
        </a>
      </h3>As a software engineer working in the San Francisco Bay Area, I get a lot of
unsolicited recruiting emails. I recently decided to dig through my email archives
and do some analysis of the long-term trends. Here are the results.

      </h3>Service meshes look great on paper but can be a huge pain to roll out
and manage. In this post, I want to share some of my war stories
and caution against diving into the service mesh hype too quickly.

This post explains why I developed the tool and how it works.

          Stop hiding levels
        </a>
      </h3>Most tech companies, even those without formal job titles,
assign "levels" to engineers. Despite the importance of levels for determining compensation
and job expectations, many companies prevent non-management employees
from seeing anyone's levels besides their own. In this post,
I explain why this is a harmful practice that should be
discontinued.

          Leaving a job
        </a>
      </h3>Over the course of my career, I've had many jobs which implies that I've also left many jobs.
Leaving a job can be awkward and emotionally draining, but, depending on the circumstances,
also liberating and life-improving. In this post, I want to provide some guidance on why, how,
and when to leave a job based on my experiences so far.

but then switched tracks and became a software engineer (SWE) three and a half years later.
In this post, I want to describe how I started as a PM, why I made the decision to switch, and
how it worked out.

in case others are considering using their services to find a job.

interviews as a candidate. In this post, I want to flip to the other side of the table
and talk about conducting better interviews from the interviewer perspective.
