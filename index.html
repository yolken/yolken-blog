      </div>Last year, I open-sourced golines, a tool that automatically shortens long lines in go code.
This post explains why I developed the tool and how it works.

      </div>Most tech companies, even those without formal job titles,
assign "levels" to engineers. Despite the importance of levels for determining compensation
and job expectations, many companies prevent non-management employees
from seeing anyone's levels besides their own. In this post,
I explain why this is a harmful practice that should be
discontinued.

Leaving a job can be awkward and emotionally draining, but, depending on the circumstances,
also liberating and life-improving. In this post, I want to provide some guidance on why, how,
and when to leave a job based on my experiences so far.
