The following are the open source projects that I've created and actively maintain:

1. [golines](https://github.com/segmentio/golines): A golang formatter that fixes long lines.
2. [topicctl](https://github.com/segmentio/topicctl): Tool for declarative management of Kafka topics.
3. [kubeapply](https://github.com/segmentio/kubeapply):
4. [data-digger](https://github.com/segmentio/data-digger):

I've also contributed to a few other projects as a non-primary author. Here are some
that are particularly interesting:

1. [kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go)
2. [dspl-tools]()
