## Academic

Between 2004 and 2009, I was a PhD student in the Stanford
University
[Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/).

I stopped doing academic research after I graduated, but
the papers I worked on might be useful to others. I'm
posting them here so that they can be accessed without paying.

### Dissertation

  Large-Scale Computing Services," May, 2009. [[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kh78HKmymBFtsjTujhY8oF3EmGWM-iic/view?usp=sharing)]
