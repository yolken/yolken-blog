Equity in one's employer is a large part of the compensation for Software Engineers.
Unfortunately, though, it can be really hard to understand, and, in some cases, actually cause
financial losses to employees. In this post, I want to describe how the different kinds of equity
work and why I strongly prefer one type, restricted stock units (RSUs), over options-based
alternatives.

#### Disclaimer

Much of the discussion in this post, particularly with regards to taxes, is US-centric. Also,
although it should be obvious, I'm not a lawyer or accountant or any kind of expert in
compensation and taxes, so everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt.

## Aside: How equity works

### Types

There are at least three kinds of equity that companies offer their employees:

| Kind  | What it is | Who offers it |
|---|---|---|
| Incentive stock options (ISOs) | Option to buy shares of the company in the future at a pre-determined (strike) price. Has most favorable tax treatment, but subject to the most restrictions (e.g., only for employees). | Small-to-mid stage startups.|
| Non-qualified stock options (NQSOs) | Option to buy shares of the company in the future at a pre-determined (strike) price. Work like ISOs, but with fewer restrictions and less favorable tax treatment. | Startups, but much less common than ISOs.|
| Restricted stock units (RSUs) | Shares of company stock that vest in the future.| Late-stage startups, public companies.|

The most common types are ISOs (generally for smaller startups) and RSUs (generally for larger startups and public companies), and we'll discuss how each of these work in more detail later.

NQSOs are fairly rare in my experience. They used to be given by public companies, sometimes
in combination with RSUs, but most of those companies have since switched over to 100% RSUs. I
haven't seen an offer that includes them since I started at Google in 2009.

### Initial grant

When you join a company that has equity-based compensation, the offer letter includes the following
details on the equity portion:

1. The type of equity
2. The total number of units
3. The *vesting schedule*, i.e. how the equity is distributed over time

So, it might say something like:

> Upon approval of our board of directors, you will be awarded an ISO grant to purchase 10,000
> shares of the company's common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value per
> share of the common stock on the date of grant. 25% of the options shall vest 12 months after
> the date your vesting begins subject to your continuing employment with the company. The
> remaining options shall vest monthly over the next 36 months in equal monthly amounts subject to
> your continuing employment with the Company.

Note that equity grants have to be approved by the company board. They don't refuse (usually!)
but since they only meet occasionally, there may be a delay of a few weeks between when you join
and when this approval happens. Depending on the terms of the company's equity plan, this
time gap may also delay the start of your vesting.

The strike price of the options is usually not set in the offer letter since it can fluctuate in
the period before the grant is approved, but you'll typically be told a rough number to expect
before signing. If it's an RSU grant, then there's no strike price to set; however, some offers
may include a clause that the number of shares can be adjusted up or down if the price of the stock
changes significantly before approval.

Note also that the vesting schedule described is fairly typical- a one year "cliff" followed
by three years of evenly monthly distributions. It's possible to get a grant with no
"cliff", but that's very rare in my experience. It's also possible, although not very common,
to get a grant with unevenly spread vesting, e.g., with 40% of the equity coming in the fourth
year.
