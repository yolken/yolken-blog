Over the last few years, many tech companies have embraced "core values"
with religious fervor. Although this process is done with good intentions,
the result is often a bland mixture of generic, feel-good principles that
do little to distinguish the company or improve employee behavior.

In this post, I want to explain what core values are, why most are meaningless,
and what can be done to make them better.

## What are core values?

Core values are a set of behavioral, non-job-specific traits that companies
expect or aspire their employees to uphold. They're most commonly a mixture of
rules for civilized behavior (e.g., "treat your coworkers with respect"),
quick tips for getting things done in a productive way (e.g.,
"be resourceful", "be rigorous", etc.), and aspirations that are never fully
attainable (e.g. "never settle", "only hire the best", "simplify to the core", etc).

The idea is to not just write down core values on a page in the employee handbook
but rather to "live" them day-to-day. Companies do this by posting their
core values prominently on their webpages (examples from companies I've worked at
or applied to: [Airbnb](https://careers.airbnb.com/),
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/),
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values),
[Slack](https://slack.com/careers)), evaluating
candidates against them during the interview process, holding multi-hour-long
sessions about them during new hire orientation, inserting random examples of them
into company all-hands meetings, and using them to grade employees during the
performance evaluation process.

## Why most are meaningless

The vast majority of corporate core values map to one of the following
buckets:

1. Be nice to your coworkers
2. Be nice to your customers / consider their needs
3. Be innovative / resourceful / bold
4. Be productive / get things done / prioritize
5. Be rigorous / thoughtful / don't be sloppy

Don't get me wrong, these are all great things. However, they're behaviors
that *all* tech companies should expect from their employees. If a company
didn't value one or more of these, then it would not be a good place to work
and would have trouble attracting and retaining both employees and customers.

Because these values are so universal and because they're so obviously
associated with good employee behavior no matter which company you're at,
they've completely non-actionable. I've never at any point in my career
had a tough decision where, for instance, the choice is between being nice
to my coworkers and being nasty to them. Even if I wanted to be mean (which
I don't), it's unlikely that having a core value of "be nice to your coworkers"
would dissuade me from doing this; the actual disincentive would be losing
my job for violating the basic norms of good behavior.

Overall, therefore, values in the five buckets above are generally meaningless.
They're the same at most companies, they don't inform decisions in people's
day-to-day work, and no matter how companies try to spin them, they're not
magical, special, or unique.

## Better core values

So, given that "most" core values are meaningless, what makes meaningful ones?

I think the most important feature of good core values is that they're *actionable*, i.e.
they actually help people make decisions when the correct choice isn't obvious. As an example,
Airbnb (one of my former employers) had a core value of "every frame matters", which
effectively meant that how things looked was really important. Thus, if I were an
engineer there and was trying to decide between making my product 30% prettier or 30%
faster, the former would be the superior choice. Google, on the other hand (another of my
former employers) had a value that "fast is better than slow"; there, the same engineer
in the same situation would be incentivized to make the opposite choice.

A second feature of good core values is that they really help to *distinguish* a company
from its peers. Airbnb's value of "every frame matters" actually reflected how design-oriented
the company was and how obsessed they were with their brand and how users perceived them.
This was a key differentiator against the bland, poorly-designed travel portals created by
competitors like Expedia and Priceline. Another example is Google's early value of "itâ€™s best to do
one thing really, really well". At the time, Google was competing against companies like Yahoo
that did search in addition to many other things too (personals, games, finance, email, etc.).
Google's focus on search allowed it to win over users and eventually dominate the space.

## Some other tips

In addition to making core values actionable and distinguishable as just described, there are a
few other things that I think can help make them more meaningful.

#### Keep the count low

Having too many core values makes them harder to remember and may also reflect poorly on
the company's ability to prioritize (ironically, many companies that have a large number of
core values include "prioritize" as one of them). I think 4-5 is a good number
in most cases.

Just because something isn't a core value doesn't mean that it's not important to the company.
Many other things, including the more generic behavioral guidelines discussed previously, can
also be valued, put on the website, used for candidate and employee evaluations, etc.

#### Don't apply core values where they aren't appropriate

Core values, no matter how important they are, are not, by themselves, sufficient conditions
for a company to be successful or for a person to be a good employee. There are many, many other,
non-behavioral things required at both the company and individual level.

This principle is often violated in the context of employee or candidate evaluations.
At one former employer, it was decided to remove all of the technical feedback from the engineer
performance evaluation process and just have questions about how well each person embodied the
company's core values. At other places, I've been asked to evaluate interview candidates on the
company's core values, even for non-behavioral interviews like coding questions.

#### Consider other names

The term "core values" often
