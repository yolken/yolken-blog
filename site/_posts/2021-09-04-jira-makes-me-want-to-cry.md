  Blah blah blah.

Every company I've worked at in the last 9 years, from small startups
to multi-thousand-person public companies, has used
[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) for managing software
projects internally.



## What is Jira?

Jira is an online project management system created by
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/), an
Australian company that makes a number of other software productivity
tools as well.

A company's Jira account is divided into "projects" which, at many companies,
map 1:1 with teams. Within each project/team, users create issues (also referred to
as "tickets") to represent individual things that need to be done,
e.g. bugs to fix or new features to add.

Issues can be listed, categorized, and reordered within a number of different
high-level views, depending on how the associated project is
configured. For instance, there might be a
[Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) that lists issues
in columns by status or a "roadmap" view that shows a
[Gantt-chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)-like summary of when issues
are projected to be done.

## What it's supposed to do

In theory, Jira



## Why I hate using it

#### It's too heavyweight

Creating a new issue in Jira is about as fun as filling out a tax form.



#### It's slow

#### There are too many ways to do things
