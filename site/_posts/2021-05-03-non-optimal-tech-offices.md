For the last year, I've been working from home (and mostly liking it!). As pandemic
restrictions ease over the next few months, however, I, along with many others in the tech
world, may be headed back to an office.

Looking back over the last decade, I've had a lot of great experiences in the offices
of my employers and for the most part these spaces have been comfortable. However,
there are certain office features that I've encountered at company after company that are not
optimal and end up unnecessarily lowering productivity and happiness.

In this post, I want to call these features out and describe how they can be fixed.

## Non-optimal office features

### Open offices

Let's start with the giant elephant in the room- the trend of throwing hundreds of desks
in a giant, open space, with no visual or auditory blockers between people. Companies
claim that they do this to "improve collaboration" but the research
[consistently shows that open offices are a net negative](https://www.workfront.com/blog/what-science-says-about-open-offices),
and common sense dictates that a big motivation is saving money on real estate costs.

At this point, I realize that we're not all going to get private offices- real estate in tech hubs
like San Francisco is just too expensive for that to be feasible. However, at the
very least open spaces should be broken up so that the noise I hear is from people that I
directly collaborate with on my team and not from a person doing sales calls for an unrelated
product.

The best shared office layout I had was when I was working for Google in Paris. The building was
really old and thus had lots of internal walls and other, "old-fashioned" architectural features
that couldn't be completely torn out. Thus, by no other choice, each team was given a private room
or semi-private alcove to share, and it was great! We could collaborate as a team when we needed to
while at the same time not disturbing everyone else in the office. And yet, it was still open
enough that you could walk around and see what others were doing.

### Desks next to noise sources

Related to the trend of open space, some offices put desks immediately adjacent to large
sources of non-work-related noise including cafeterias, all-hands meeting spaces, open atria,
office circulation paths, and service help desks.

Over the years, I've been seated next to break-area coffee grinders (that noise drives me crazy!),
tech support desks (hearing people complaining about the slow WiFi on their laptops over and over),
and busy walkways (including frequent and very noisy tours being given to visitors). By far the
worst experience, however, was a job where I sat directly next to the kitchen and had to spend all
day listening to the head chef plan his menus and discipline the cafeteria staff.

Unless you're trying to encourage collaboration between your product team and your food team,
there's no rational reason to do this, and it just causes frustration on both sides. Desk areas
should be completely separated from the places where food is prepared and served, where meetings
are held, and where every person in the building needs to walk by to get to or from their work
areas.

### Non-adjustable desks

A decade ago, height-adjustable desks were exotic and expensive, and thus very few offices
had them. In 2021, though, they're cheap and ubiquitous (even Ikea sells them), and thus there's
no excuse to not have them.

For me, the biggest benefit of these "standing desks" isn't the standing part but rather that I can
make the surface super low. Since I'm shorter than average, the "standard" desk
height is too high for me and makes it uncomfortable to type for long periods. Other people
are most productive when their desks are higher than "standard" or at full standing height, so
everyone can be happy.

Even worse than individual, non-adjustable desks is the "shared countertop" layout that became
popular a few years ago. These not only have the issue that the height is non-optimal, but also
that you can feel the surface vibrate with each keystroke made by your neighbors. At one job,
these vibrations were so distracting that I just couldn't get any work done; thankfully, after
multiple rounds of escalation, I managed to get a "private" desk that was attached to nothing else
but the floor.

### Overly decorated offices

Decorations like plants and wall artwork can really improve the environment in an office.
Some companies, however, take the decoration process too far, to the point that the form
overwhelms the function and makes it harder to get work done.

I'm going to abandon my normal discretion here and name names- Airbnb (where I worked for two years)
