I spent 5 years of my life getting a PhD, but like many others who've gotten this degree,
I decided to leave academia after graduation. At the time, I explored several career choices
but ultimately decided to take a Product Manager job at Google.

Since then, I've [switched ladders once](/blog/switching-from-product-to-eng) and
[companies a few times](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yolken/), but overall have absolutely no regrets
about going into tech versus the other paths that I could have taken.

In this post, I want to discuss why I think it's a great destination for people with technical PhDs
and also dig into the "career ladders" that most tech companies have.

#### Quick note on terminology

I'm using "tech" to mean computer software and/or hardware technology companies. There's
also biotech, but given that I haven't done anything bio-related since my high school science
classes, I'm not really qualified to discuss that side of the world.

Also, the intended audience here is "technical" PhDs, i.e. those in the sciences and engineering.
You can certainly go into tech with a PhD in French Literature, but the degree will be less of a
benefit, and you'll have to prove your technical skills in some other way.
