After nearly 10 years of living in San Francisco, I decided to
leave at the end of last year. In this post, I explain what
motivated my departure and how the city can improve in the future.

## Problems

For the majority of my time in SF, I was pretty happy with life there.
I had a great apartment in a great location. Although I had a car,
I rarely used it because I could easily walk to the train, the city's
main shopping district (Union Square), or the offices of my various
employers over the years.

Starting 4-5 years ago, however, things started changing for the
worse, and then they accelerated downwards during the pandemic. It's hard
to pin down exactly what happened and when, and nor am I an expert in sociology
or public health or any topic like that, but I think the core problem
for me was that my sense of *safety* significantly degraded.

### Physical safety

My biggest problem with SF was simply not feeling physically safe on the
streets. SF has a pretty low violent crime rate (at least by US standards), so
I wasn't worried about getting shot or robbed or anything like that.

Instead, the problem was that SF had (and still has today), thousands
of people wandering around who are suffering from drug addiction and/or
severe mental illness. The vast majority of these folks were completely
harmless, but a small percentage were hostile, threatening, and, in some
cases, violent.

In multiple cases over the years, I was followed, screamed at, and
threatened in broad daylight. Thankfully, nothing physically happened
to me, but it's a really jarring experience to have this happen. Each time
I reported these incidents to the police, they never responded. I got the
sense that if no one was physically harmed, they didn't really care. Thus,
there were no mechanisms in place to control, contain, or treat this
behavior.

Over time, I realized that you needed to be hyper-vigilant every time you
left the house, constantly evaluating everyone around you and being ready
to cross the street or reverse direction at a moment's notice. Is that
person screaming and throwing trash at the side of a bus shelter a
danger, or are they going to keep to themselves if I walk quickly past?
What about that group that's selling drugs in the middle of the sidewalk?

It just got really stressful and draining over time.

### Drugs

Closely related to the issue of physical safety is drugs. When I moved to my
neighborhood (Mission Street between 7th and 8th), it wasn't super exciting but at
least it was pretty clean and quiet. Then, a few years ago, gangs of drug dealers
moved in. They first took over the 7th street corner and then, during the pandemic,
also expanded to the 8th street side of my block. By the end, I couldn't leave the
house without walking through them.

Most of the time, this activity was peaceful. However, it brought more people
to the neighborhood who were loud, destructive, and potentially threatening.
The sidewalks became blocked in places, and I often had to walk in the street
to get around the dealers, their customers, and the piles of trash they left
behind.

Occasionally, violence did flare up. There were two, drug-related murders
on my block in the last year, one of which I heard the gunshots for. And, people
were constantly overdosing, and often dying. In my final weeks, I saw a
dead body on the sidewalk being attended to by the coroner's office.

### Street safety

The final safety dimension that affected me was



## Why it's frustrating


## Why it matters

In the pre-pandemic days, most companies required employees to be in the
office at least 4 days a week. Many Bay Area companies, including most
of the big tech employers (Google, Facebook, etc.), had large offices
in downtown San Francisco, and as a result, many of their employees lived
in the city to avoid long commutes.

With the pandemic, much of this disappeared. Companies

## Answers to common comments and questions

Whenever anyone complains about SF in the news or social media, they're

#### Most of SF is perfectly nice. You should have just moved to a different neighborhood.

First, I wanted to live in a dense, central area and not in a single-family-house
that's 4 miles from downtown. Second, my neighborhood was perfectly nice when
I moved in, and then got bad. What's to prevent that from happening to other
places in the city as well?

#### The stats show that SF is doing well. Assaults, burglaries (substitute some other metric here) are down!



#### Other cities in the US are just as bad. Stop picking on SF!

This is simply not true.

#### SF was much worse in the 90's (substitute some other decade here).

Who cares?

#### You're a terrible, negative person- good riddance!
