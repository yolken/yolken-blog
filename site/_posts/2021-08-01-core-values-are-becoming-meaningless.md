Over the last few years, many tech companies have embraced "core values"
with religious fervor. Although this process is done with good intentions,
the result is often a bland mixture of generic, feel-good principles that
do little to distinguish the company or improve employee behavior.

In this post, I want to explain what core values are, why many are meaningless,
and what can be done to make them better.

## What are core values?

Core values are a set of behavioral, non-job-specific traits that companies
expect or aspire their employees to uphold. They're most commonly a mixture of
rules for civilized behavior (e.g., "treat your coworkers with respect"),
quick tips for getting things done in a productive way (e.g.,
"be resourceful", "be rigorous", etc.), and aspirations that are never fully
attainable, e.g. "never settle", "only hire the best", "simplify to the core", etc.


## Most are pretty generic

The vast majority of tech company core values map to one of the following:

1. Be nice to your coworkers
2. Be nice to your customers and consider their needs
3. Be innovative / resourceful / scrappy
4. Be productive / get things done
5. Be rigorous / thoughtful / don't be sloppy

Don't get me wrong, these are all great things. However, they're behaviors
that *all* tech companies should expect from their employees.


## Conclusion
