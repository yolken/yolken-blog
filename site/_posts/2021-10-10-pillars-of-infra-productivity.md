During my career, I've spent a lot of time dealing with software infrastructure (infra), both
as a "customer", i.e. on a team using the infrastructure, and also as a "provider", i.e.
on a team that maintains this infrastructure for others engineers in the company.

I've been at companies where infra-related work is a pleasure, and others where it's a huge pain
and serious drain on productivity. In this post, I want to describe why infrastructure
is so important and some "pillars" that ensure that the engineers in a company are happy
and productive when interacting with it.

## Aside: What is infrastructure and why is it important

Software

## The Pillars

### Pillar 0: Solid foundational components

### Pillar 1: Great tooling

### Pillar 2: Great documentation

### Pillar 3: Self-service workflows

### Pillar 4: Fast iteration times

## Conclusion
