A large percentage of software engineers spend years at the "senior engineer" level. At
many companies, including most of my former employers (i.e., Google, Twitter, Airbnb, and Stripe),
this level is fairly straightforward to get into, but hard to get promoted beyond. The difficulty in
advancing past "senior" can cause a lot of frustration and make people feel stuck in their
careers.

In this post, I want to share some observations about this "senior engineer plateau", why
it causes frustration, and how to navigate out of it.

## Aside: The senior engineer level

As described in [my earlier blog post](/blog/stop-hiding-levels), most
companies beyond a small size have well-defined career ladders for software engineers, with at
least 4 levels. The details vary from company to company, but in most of these ladders the
"senior" level is what employees get to after 5+ years of industry experience.

At most places, this rung on the ladder is also considered the "career level", which implies a few
things. First, this means that once you get to it, you can stay in it forever- as long as you meet
expectations, you can spend 30+ years as a senior engineer, and no one will ever complain about
your lack of ambition or try to push you out for not advancing further.

Second, as the "career level", it means that people's careers naturally flow into it. Assuming
the correct mentorship, management, project work, etc., most company promotion processes don't
put up lots of barriers for people getting to "senior" and, moreover, might even require them to do
this after a certain number of years at the company.

Once you get to senior, however, the path beyond it can be much harder. Because staff and higher
roles can come with significantly more compensation (discussed below) and because not everyone
is expected to get up to these levels, companies are much, much pickier about how and why they
promote people into them.

## Aside: Why level matters

A common statement I hear is that "levels don't matter" and thus that people shouldn't care whether
they're stuck at senior or somewhere else on the ladder for a long time.

While this is true from a strictly title-based standpoint (personally, and like many others, I
really don't care whether my LinkedIn profile says "software engineer" as opposed to "staff software
engineer" or something else), the reality is that levels are more than just words.

First, they're an acknowledgement of the work that you've done. Many engineers, myself included,
are motivated by working on things that matter, and levels are one way (but certainly not the only
way) to express that one's work is valued and has had a positive impact at the company.

Second, and probably more importantly for many, levels can play a big role in compensation. As
described in [my earlier blog post](/blog/stop-hiding-levels), each level has associated salary and
equity bands. Once you hit the upper end of the band, which may happen relatively quickly if you
negotiated well for your initial offer, it's hard to get significant increases from year-to-year.

There are a few other ways, beyond pay bands, that levels affect compensation. At some companies
significant equity increases are tied to promotion. If you don't get promoted, you might not get
stock refreshers frequently. Also, at companies with bonus programs, the target is often tied
to level. When I was at Stripe, for instance, senior engineers had a target of 10% of base salary
whereas staff had a 20% one. This meant that, all else being equal, staff engineers would get
significantly larger bonuses. Google also had level-specific targets when I was there.

These links between levels and pay are not always 100% fair, but they're the reality of the
compensation systems at most tech companies. Thus, you sometimes need to "work the system"
around levels to ensure that you're paid competitively.

## Common frustrations

The following sections describe some of the common frustrations that I've felt myself and/or
observed in other senior engineers over my last few jobs.

#### Productivity alone is not sufficient

Many senior engineers are super productive from a coding standpoint- because they're experienced
enough to know what they're doing (usually) and because they don't have the extra responsibilities
of managers and more senior level ICs, they're often at the sweet spot where they can "get stuff
done" with minimal distractions.

Unfortunately, though, this productivity alone is often not sufficient for getting promoted.
It's a data point for sure, but at many companies it's just one of many things that's considered.

This causes frustration for many, and was personally something that puzzled me earlier in my
career, because intuitively it feels like productivity *should* be the main criterion for promotion.
Engineers are hired to create software just as doctors are hired to treat patients and artists are
hired to make art. So, if you are more hard-working and efficient at creating software and related
outputs (e.g., documentation, bug fixes, etc.) than others, you should be rewarded with a promotion.

But, alas, this isn't how most career ladders are set up- these systems reward "impact" as opposed
to "output". Productivity is a necessary condition for having a positive impact in an
organization, but, particularly as you get into higher levels, other things like working on
projects that are sufficiently complex, demonstrating cross-team leadership, being visible, etc. are
required as well.

#### Breadth over depth

A related frustration I've seen with getting to staff level at large companies is that the
promotion criteria often place a bigger emphasis on breadth as opposed to depth. You can be an
expert in a technical field and do great work there, but if you don't also check off other boxes
(e.g., cross-team coordination, mentorship, etc.), then you'll likely hit roadblocks in getting
to the next level.

Thus, the system tends to reward people whose work is "horizontal", i.e. spread across multiple
projects, domains, and types of work as opposed to those who are more "vertically" focused
on a specific thing. This isn't necessarily wrong (horizontal work can have a big, positive impact
on a company and should be rewarded as such), but it is something to be aware of and is something
that can cause some frustration if, like me, you're more about depth than breadth.

#### Visibility required

For promotion to senior and lower levels, the direct manager's word is usually enough- if the
manager says that one of their reports is ready for the next level, and there's some basic peer
validation, then the person will most likely get promoted.

For staff and higher levels, though, the manager's word is typically not enough. The person up for
promotion could be the greatest engineer in the world, but if no one outside of their immediate
team can affirm this, then they're unlikely to get to the next level.

The easiest way to get this affirmation is to be *visible* to those outside of your team and
particularly to those who are making the promotion decision. Unfortunately, though, this can be
hard if you're super introverted (as I am), or you're working head's down on a deep technical
problem that isn't flashy and doesn't naturally lend itself to cross-company visibility.

## How to fix it

#### Find the right role

This might come across as a bit extreme, but if you really care about career advancement then
the most important thing is to find a company and a role where the work and evaluation criteria
match your strengths. Personally, I feel that I'm strongest on the productivity side
and less good at the "cross-team coordination", "evangelizing new technologies across the company",
and other dimensions that high-level ICs are promoted for. Other people, however, might excel at
the latter and not want to spend all day pumping out pull requests.

It's important to note here that there can be a ton of variation not only between companies at a
high-level but also between the roles within a company. Backend infrastructure engineers in
division X, for instance, might be evaluated differently than frontend product engineers in the same
division, and these two groups might be evaluated differently than engineers doing similar work in
division Y at the same company.

Before you sign a new job offer or switch teams inside a company, it's really important to assess
your strengths and compare them to the work outputs and behaviors that are rewarded for the role.

#### Make sure you check the boxes

As mentioned above, many companies evaluate employees on a broad set of criteria and require
positive signal in all of them before allowing a promotion. Thus, if you're trying to advance
it's really important that you "check off all the boxes", even if some of these aren't fun or
aligned to your strengths. So, for instance, if getting to staff requires "mentorship experience",
then it's important that you have some opportunity to do this, e.g. by hosting an intern for the
summer.

You should consult your company's career ladder documentation and work closely with your direct
manager to figure out what these boxes are and how you can fill out the missing pieces.

#### Improve your visibility

Getting more visibility for yourself and your work is really key for advancing to higher
levels. Even if you're introverted and even if it's uncomfortable, you need to ensure that
the people evaluating your work understand what you're doing and why it's important.

In some cases, for instance if you're at a really small company or working on a flashy,
high-visibility product in a larger company, the visibility comes for free. In other cases,
though, you need to do extra work to get this. Some tips here include:

1. Do regular "skip level" 1:1s with your manager's manager; if they don't understand your work
  and aren't promoting you to others, then it's going to be hard to get ahead.
2. Send out progress reports, launch announcements, etc. so others beyond your immediate team
  know what you and your colleagues are working on.
3. Write blog posts, present at conferences, do internal "tech talks", and participate in other
  activities that allow you to build your personal brand and promote your work.

## Conclusion

At many companies, the senior engineer level is easy to get into but hard to advance beyond.
I personally felt stuck at senior earlier in my career and many of my colleagues over the years
have experienced similar feelings.

The key thing is to realize how the system works and ensure that where you're working and what
you're working on are aligned with your long-term career goals. Once you achieve this alignment,
advancing can still be slow but at least there's a clear, achievable path to follow.
