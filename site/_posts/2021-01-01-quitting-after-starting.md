Last year, I did something that I'd never done in my career before- I left a job
(at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai)) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.

## What happened

Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com), where I'd
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details here are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn't very happy with my personal situation:

1. The work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated
2. The upper rungs of Stripe individual contributor (IC) engineering ladder put a lot of emphasis
on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn't enjoy and felt I
wasn't very good at; it would be hard for me to advance
3. There weren't any other teams that I was super-excited about transferring into

Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.

After a few weekends of furiously paced [Leetcoding](/blog/master-coding-interviews), I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn't any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my [backlog of recruiting emails](/blog/six-years-of-emails)
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among these was [Nuro](https://nuro.ai), an
autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless grocery delivery.

Over the following weeks, I continued through the process and ended up doing around seven onsites,
including one at Nuro. In the end, I didn't fall in love with any of the options, but there
was something that made me feel optimistic about Nuro. Being a hardware-oriented, robotics company
it was just really different from all of my previous employers, and, after years of feeling stuck
in my career, maybe different was good.

They were quite secretive about

In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer.






## Lessons learned

#### Do your due diligence

Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn't be done impulsively.

#### It's ok to quit after a few weeks (just don't make it a pattern)

I was worried that

#### Switch teams before quitting

As I noted in my early post

#### Understand the process for going back to your old job
