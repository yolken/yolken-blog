I recently got back from a vacation to the East Coast of the US. For two days during my trip,
I biked around New York City and explored various neighborhoods, parks, and bridges.

In this post (my first that's not about tech!), I want to share my routes and also my observations
from the perspective of someone who has done most of their biking in San Francisco Bay Area.

## Logistics

New York has a massive bike share program, [Citi Bike](https://citibikenyc.com/homepage), with
stations all over the city. These bikes are relatively cheap to rent ($15 / day), but they're heavy
and not designed for steep hills, so I decided to go a little more upscale and rent a nicer bike
each day from a [bike rental kiosk](https://bikerent.nyc/) in
[Central Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park).

The kiosk bikes were still not amazing as they were designed more for cruising than hardcore rides,
but they at least had more gears, better brakes, and lighter frames.

Each day, I walked from my hotel in Times Square to the rental kiosk, paid $40 for a day-long
rental, and then was off riding within a few minutes. Central Park, as implied by its name,
is centrally located, so it was easy to go off in various directions based on the plan for the
day.

## Ride 1: Manhattan

On the first day, I did Manhattan from end-to-end:

    <strong>Total distance:</strong> 40.36 miles.<br/>
    <strong>Net elevation gain:</strong> 1,086 feet.<br/>
    See <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5981756660">Strava</a> for more details.

Starting in at the kiosk in the southwest corner of Central Park, I went up through the park
then took local streets from the north side of the park to the upper tip of Manhattan. This
took me through the neighborhoods of [Harlem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem),
[Washington Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan), and
[Inwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood,_Manhattan).

I then took the [Hudson River Greenway](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/rides/hudson-river-greenway),
a paved, off-street bike trail, down the entire west side of Manhattan to
[The Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Manhattan)) at the southern tip of the
island.

Finally, I took local streets back up to midtown Manhattan, doing some loops among the
high-rises of the [Upper East Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_East_Side) and
[Midtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan) before turning my bike in at the end
of the day.

## Ride 2: Brooklyn

On day two, I did a big loop through Brooklyn, bounded by some mileage in Queens and Manhattan:

  <figcaption style="font-size:0.8em">
    <strong>Total distance:</strong> 40.89 miles.<br/>
    <strong>Net elevation gain:</strong> 1,086 feet.<br/>
    See <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5987844467">Strava</a> for more details.

I started by going east across Midtown and then over the
[Queensboro Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensboro_Bridge) into Queens. I then went
south into Brooklyn, passing by the hip and expensive new housing developments along the riverfront
in [Greenpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpoint,_Brooklyn) and
[Williamsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn).

I then cut island and looped around some less gentrified areas of Brooklyn, including the
neighborhoods of [Crown Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Heights,_Brooklyn),
[Flatbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatbush,_Brooklyn),
[Borough Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_Park,_Brooklyn), and
[Sunset Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Park,_Brooklyn).

This was definitely the most interesting part of my ride. Far away from the touristy and yuppified
parts of Manhattan, there was an incredible diversity of architecture, businesses, and people.
Based on the specific location, the population varied from Orthodox Jews to Chinese immigrants,
and the building stock from concrete high-rises to beautiful, suburban-like, single family
homes.

In Sunset Park, I turned back north and ended up in Downtown Brooklyn. After a quick break, I
crossed over the [Brooklyn Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge) back into
Manhattan, took local streets back up to Midtown, and then did some loops around
[Hell's Kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan) and the
[Upper West Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_West_Side) before returning my bike.

## Observations

Overall, the rides were a lot of fun.

#### Bike infrastructure has improved a lot

The last time I rode in New York City was in 2004. At the time, there were paths along the rivers
and over the bridges, but most other areas of the city were a biking wasteland

#### Bikers don't follow traffic laws

#### Bike lanes are
