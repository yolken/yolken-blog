Over the course of my tech career thus far, I've been through two acquisitions. In each case,
I was just a normal employee without any special inside knowledge, and found out only a few days
before the deals were publicly announced. In retrospect, however,

## Background: Why do tech acquisitions happen?

Most tech companies require a lot of investor money at the beginning so they can hire
employees, build out offices, and market to customers. Like all investors, the individuals and
venture firms putting in the cash expect to recoup their investments, plus a healthy profit. Unlike
more staid, institutional investors, however, they want to do it *fast*, typically within ten
years.

In addition, most employees of these "startups" receive equity, and in many cases this can be
a significant chunk of their compensation. This equity, however, is effectively not sellable
(and some would even say "worthless") for as long as the company stays private.

The end result is that, after a few years, both investors and employees are very much itching for a
*liquidity event* that will turn their illiquid company shares into either cash or shares
in a public company that can be sold in the open market.

There are two main paths to achieve this liquidity- the company can either be acquired
or "go public" though an initial public offering (IPO) or direct listing.

Going public is definitely the more glamorous of the two, but it's a huge pain to execute on-
it takes many years of preparation, timing the market, dealing with regulatory requirements,
hiring expensive investment bankers, doing roadshows, etc.

Getting acquired, by comparison, is relatively straightforward, and quickly provides liquidity
to investors and employees. It's not as glamourous, and it requires ceding control to the
acquirer, but in today's environment it can still be very profitable. As a result, acquisitions
are pretty common.

## My acquisition experiences

My first acquisition occurred in 2013, when my employer, MoPub, was acquired by Twitter. I had
joined the year before when the company was around 45 employees. Over the course of that year,
the company had done really well, and had more than doubled in size since I joined.

The second acquisition happened in 2020 (just a few weeks ago!), when Segment was acquired
by Twilio. As with MoPub, this happened after about a year of me starting. But, in this case,
I had joined the company at a much later stage, when it was around 500 employees, and growth
was a bit lower.

The acquisition experiences were super interesting, but I'm going to save talking about
them for a later post. Let's now get to the signs I saw in both cases that indicated something
unusual was going on.

## The signs an acquisition is coming

### Founders and executives are distracted

Getting a multi-hundred million or multi-billion dollar acquisition deal across the line requires
a massive amount of effort. It starts with initial discussions then evolves into full-fledged
negotiations, sometimes with multiple suitors at once. Once the outline of a deal is reached, the
potential acquirer spends several weeks doing do diligence.

Dealing with all this plus the prospect of a massive payday down the line is super distracting.
Unless you're an amazing actor (which few people are), it's hard to pretend that you're still
super excited about the weekly product plan, the regular company all-hands, and other mundane,
day-to-day operational details.

In both the MoPub and Segment cases, I noticed this change in behavior in the founders and
non-founder executives beginning a few weeks before the acquisitions happened. It was subtle,


### Increased focus on security

A big chunk of the due diligence process that happens before a deal is signed involves evaluating
security vulnerabilities in the acquiree and then, as the deal gets closer, fixing any critical
issues found. No acquirer wants to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for a company and then have
hackers get in and steal all of the customer data and intellectual property.

In the case of Segment, we had a very strong security team that handled these issues. However,
MoPub had no security team, and in fact had

### Lack of urgency around hiring

### Unusual meetings and meeting changes
