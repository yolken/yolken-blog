I've written a few previous posts about quitting a job
(see [1](/blog/leaving-a-job) and [2](/blog/quitting-a-new-job)).
Now, I want to turn my attention to a happier and more exciting topic-
what happens when you show up for the first day at your next company.

Starting a new software engineering job is hard, and making this process
successful requires a lot of effort from both the employer and the
employee. In this post, I want to focus on the former, and in particular
how companies can make their onboarding processes better. A follow-up post
will offer advice on getting up-to-speed from the employee perspective.

## Onboarding approaches

I've gone through seven onboardings in my tech career so far. Although the details
have varied a lot from company to company, I've broadly seen four different
styles of onboarding programs; these are described below, ordered by intensity.

### Full bootcamp

The most intense onboarding process is what's referred to as engineer "bootcamp".

The analogy here is to bootcamp (also called "basic training") programs in the
military. These work by taking a bunch of people from different backgrounds,
grinding them down, and then building them back up in a uniform, structured way
that lays the foundation for being a good soldier. Those who graduate then go on
to more specialized training for their specific roles.

Tech onboarding bootcamps aren't quite as intense (no head shaving or being
yelled at by a drill sergeant fortunately!), but the general idea is the same.


### Mini-project bootcamp

A less intense variant of the full bootcamp is one in which the new engineers
are all pre-assigned to teams, so there's no weed-out or team selection process.
Instead, the starting class is divided into smaller teams, each of which works
on a mini-project for a few weeks to get more familiar with the company's tools,
systems, and products. After the project is done, the teams are disbanded and people
begin onboarding with their real, assigned teams.

I went through a process like this when I started at Stripe- they called it
"dev/start", and it took around 5 weeks. I've heard of other companies having
programs like this, but they're typically optional and intended primarily for
more junior engineers.

### Lightweight, team-based

The next level down involves

### Bare bones

The least

## What works, what doesn't

### 2 days of classes are enough



### Team assignment should be handled before arrival
