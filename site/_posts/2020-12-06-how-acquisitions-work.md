In [an earlier post](/blog/youre-about-to-be-acquired), I listed out signs that your employer is
about to be acquired. In this one, I want to talk about how the tech acquisition process works
from end-to-end, based on my personal experiences.

## Background: My acquisition experiences

My first acquisition occurred in 2013, when my employer, [MoPub](https://mopub.com/), was acquired
by [Twitter](https://twitter.com). I had joined the year before when the company was around 45
employees. Over the course of that year, the company had done really well, and by the time we were
acquired we had more than doubled in size.

The second acquisition happened in 2020 (just a few weeks ago!), when
[Segment](https://segment.com/) was bought by [Twilio](https://twilio.com). As with MoPub,
this happened about a year after I started. But, in this case, I had joined the company at
a much later stage, when it was around 500 employees, and growth was a bit lower.

It's important to note that these were successful acquisitions for both investors
and employees: the amount paid was significantly greater than the amount raised, nearly
all employees got offers at the

## Why acquisitions happen

Running a tech startup is a very expensive endeavor. The vast majority of companies
depend on millions (or tens of millions, or hundreds of millions) of money from outside investors
to hire lots of staff, lease fancy offices, market their products, and do other things to attain
the high growth rates expected in the industry.

These investors expect to earn their money back, plus a healthy return, within a relatively
quick time frame (typically in under ten years). In addition, employees and other insiders
are given equity in the company as a part of their compensation. While the company is still
private, however, this equity is highly illiquid.

The end result is that there is strong pressure on startup executives and boards for a
"liquidity event" at some point in the company's first decade of life. Although an
[IPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) is the flashiest way to do this and the
one with the highest potential returns, it's a huge pain to execute. You need to be the right
size, have the right financial numbers, time the market, hire lots of expensive bankers, deal with
messy compliance issues (e.g., [SOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act)),
etc.

Getting acquired is faster and easier, while still being potentially very profitable. Thus, it's
the exit choice taken by a lot of companies.

## The process

### 1: Initial negotiation

Acquisitions begin with negotiation between the company and the potential acquirer. Movies and TV
shows make this process out to be super dramatic, happening in fancy boardrooms crammed with
people in expensive clothing yelling and insulting each other. But, the reality is probably more
boring- lots of emails, phone calls, and informal chats between the two companies and internally
within their boards of directors.

Given the complexity of these deals and the amount of money involved, lawyers and other external
advisors will start getting involved at this stage. However, employees are generally not going
to be told anything yet.

### 2: Formal declaration of intent

The first big milestone is often a "letter of intent" or "term sheet" which lays out the basic
outline of the proposed acquisition. The key details here are the amount that the acquirer
intends to pay and the general structure of the deal (i.e., whether the acquirer will pay cash or
be providing equity). This agreement also explains what needs to happen for the deal to actually
be signed, and in particular the due diligence that has to be done.

The agreement itself it typically non-binding. However, it would be considered poor form for
either side to pull out or demand a significant change in terms without good reason, so it
serves as a fairly reliable starting point for any final agreement.

As with the initial negotiation, the details are confidential and employees are usually not
told anything.

### 3: Due diligence and agreement drafting

After the initial terms are agreed to, the deal enters an intense "due diligence" phase. Just as
you wouldn't buy a house without doing an inspection first, an acquirer is not going to plunk down
hundreds of millions of dollars until they're very certain of what they're buying.

A big chunk of this due diligence, and the one most likely to affect engineer employees, involves
the company's technology. The acquirer will have tons of questions about the architecture, tech
stack, and other implementation details of the company's systems. They may review the code manually
and also scan it for security vulnerabilities and use of non-permissive open-source licenses.



### 4: Agreement signed



### 5: Signing to closing



### 6: Closing

The closing is when the deal actually comes to fruition and the acquisition is executed. After
closing, the acquiree no longer exists as an independent company, and its employees are now
formally part of the acquiring company.
