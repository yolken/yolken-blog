One of the cool things about software engineering is that the associated technologies
are constantly changing. This applies not just to the technical things we build with (i.e., the
programming languages, frameworks, hardware, etc.), but also the tools that we use to
make ourselves better organized and productive.

Since I switched into engineering 8 years ago, I've witnessed a few tools in the latter
category that have really been "transformative" in terms of how I do my day-to-day work. In this
post, I want to share my experiences with them and also discuss some areas that are still
a pain and really in need transformation.

#### Ground rules

For the basis of this post, I'm only considering things that are related to process or
productivity, i.e. not specific languages, frameworks, technical systems, etc. Also,
I'm skipping tools that came to prominence more than 8 years ago, which includes Github, GMail,
Google Docs, and many other things that are still very popular and useful today.

## Transformative tools

### Slack

When I started my career, email was everything. I spent hours each day reading through reams
of messages and crafting well-written, doubly-proofread replies in long, back-and-forth threads
with colleagues and executives.

Now, I write maybe one email a month at work. The vast majority of the back-and-forth conversation
that used to happen in email is now in [Slack](https://www.slack.com), a cloud-based communication
system that provides instant group and 1:1 chat. These technologies have been around for a while
(I remember them from my dial-up AOL account in the 1990's), but Slack packages them in a pretty,
feature-rich way and has been very successful at getting adoption inside tech companies over the
last few years.

Having a conversation in Slack is obviously faster than having one over email. However, the key
benefit for me with Slack is that I can edit or delete messages after I've posted them. Now,
I can just say what's on my mind and if I'm wrong about something (as I often am), I can go
back and correct myself. Gone is the fear around referring to the wrong system when debugging
a problem, making a spelling mistake, expressing an opinion too forcefully, or other things
that obsessive people like me used to worry about and get slowed down by when drafting emails.

These features, combined with all the other bells and whistles that Slack offers, have really
transformed how I communicate at work. Of course, there are some downsides, particularly in that it
enables more frequent, lower-quality interruptions. On the whole, though, I think Slack and its
competitors (e.g.,
[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software))
have been a net positive and can really transform communication in other industries as well.

### VSCode

Software engineers spend a lot of time writing and editing text files. These include not just
code but also the configuration files and documentation that live alongside the former.

When I started my career, the choices here were either to use a very lightweight, bare-bones
text editor on the one hand, or a heavyweight, bloated
[integrated developer environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
on the other. Many of these tools were not free software
(I remember [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) in particular), required hours
to set up correctly, and would often have performance issues when working in large projects.

Now, I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for nearly all text editing. VSCode is developed
by Microsoft, but unlike most of their historical products, it's
free and open-source. I was a little skeptical when it first came out- I haven't enjoyed any
Microsoft products since [Flight Simulator 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2004:_A_Century_of_Flight)- but since then I've been won over.

The transformational thing about VSCode for me is that it strikes the right balance between
a lightweight text editor and an IDE. I can use it for the plain Markdown of this blog
but then switch into a golang or Python project and get code completion, error checking,
and other, IDE-ish features without the associated bloat.

VSCode is far from perfect, and there are some situations in which I still wouldn't use it;
in large Java or Scala projects, I would probably stick with
[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), for instance. But, it's continually improving,
super extensible, and has a robust and growing third-party developer community. It's significantly
improved my productivity and happiness, and I imagine that it will only get more adoption over time.

### Docker Compose

Containerization, i.e. the ability to easily run processes in semi-isolated environments, has
had a big impact on how software is deployed in production. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
popularized the technology, and since then it's played a key role in
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and other large-scale, orchestration frameworks.

Personally, though, I think the biggest benefit to containerization has been in how I run
software on my local machine.
