A lot of companies, both in tech and other industries, are having trouble
retaining employees at the moment. The so-called
["great resignation"](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/great-resignation-accelerating/620382/)
of 2021 has gotten a lot of newfound press coverage, but in reality these resignation waves are
nothing new in tech; in an industry where companies can rise and fall quickly and where
many people can easily move between jobs, individual companies will often have retention problems
even if the broader economy does not.

In this post, I want to describe the various resignation waves that I've seen
in my career thus far and what companies can do to respond to these events.

## When retention is a problem

Even the best companies under the most auspicious circumstances will have some
voluntary turnover. It's just natural that in any given year, a small percentage of
otherwise happy employees will want to retire, go back to school, move to a smaller
company, or pursue some other opportunity that causes them to quit their jobs.

Companies build this kind of steady, predictable turnover into their hiring plans,
and it generally doesn't cause problems. New people come in to the replace the ones who
leave, and the refresh rate is slow enough that it doesn't disrupt operations or affect
morale.

Sometimes, however, internal or external circumstances can disrupt this balance, causing the rate
of people voluntarily leaving to go beyond a comfortable threshold. This has a number of negative
effects inside the company, including:

1. People leave faster than they can be replaced. The workload on the remaining people goes up
   significantly and team plans need to be trimmed because of staffing shortages.
2. The people leaving have special skills and knowledge that has been built up over their time
   at the company. Even if their positions are backfilled quickly, it takes a long time for the
   new people to become as productive as those they're replacing.
3. People lose colleagues who they enjoyed working with and made them motivated to stay.

The big problem here is that many of these things form amplifying feedback loops. As more and more
good people leave, the burden on the remaining employees becomes higher and they themselves
become more likely to quit, which just makes the retention problems worse.

I've personally observed various degrees of these resignation spirals at a few points in my career;
some examples include:

- **At Google in 2010/11:** Facebook and others started aggressively poaching employees so they
  could build their own variants of Google's technologies and products. This didn't affect the
  teams I worked with at the time, but it apparently was causing a lot of specialized talent in
  certain areas (e.g., data center hardware and web search) to leave.
- **At Twitter in 2015:** User growth came to a standstill, and the stock started tanking. Many
  employees received a significant fraction of their compensation in equity, which meant their pay
  decreased a lot. At the same time, various executives were also quitting or being forced out,
  which made the company seem rudderless and further lowered morale.
- **At Twilio/Segment (my current employer) this year:** The "great resignation" is happening and,
  moreover, some are feeling post-acquisition malaise and want to return to smaller
  companies.

## The wrong response

Companies are continually monitoring internal data on employee departures and comparing their
numbers to industry benchmarks. The most common response I've seen from company leadership when
attrition numbers creep up is to dismiss them as not a serious concern as
long as the company average stays under some pre-determined threshold, e.g. 20% per year. Even if
employees start noticing that more and more of their colleagues are leaving and start raising
concerns, it's easiest to say "we're ok because we're well below X%" (whatever the threshold is).

This type of response is infuriating for so many reasons.

First, attrition isn't going to uniform across a company with hundreds or thousands of
employees. It's highly likely that certain classes of people (e.g., senior engineers or people
in a particular division) are quitting at a higher rate than the average value. Within these
groups, localized resignation feedback loops can form before they show up in a company average.

Second, attrition is a *trailing* metric. The number only reflects the final outcome (employees
leaving), which may happen many months after people become unhappy and start to look for new jobs.
A third of the company could be in the process of leaving, but you won't see that in the attrition
numbers until they're gone.

Third, it takes a while for any mitigation to take effect. Increasing pay or giving people more
equity, for instance, may take months (because of board approval, budgeting processes, etc.). If
employees are already in the process of looking elsewhere and have momentum in that process, the
promise of a pay raise in six months might be too late to have any effect.

## What to do instead

#### Respond early

The key to keeping retention problems under control is to respond to them *before* the feedback
loops described above can take hold. If attrition is low but steadily increasing, this
is a sign of a serious problem that, at the very least, needs to be acknowledged and investigated.

#### Aggressively adjust pay

Increasing pay is a key lever for increasing retention and making people more reluctant to quit.
Unfortunately, many larger companies have rigid schedules and procedures around pay adjustments,
e.g. only considering merit increases once a year or only allocating a fixed budget (say, 3%
per employee per year on average) for these increases.

#### Make it easier for employees to move internally



#### Don't wait for people to give notice
