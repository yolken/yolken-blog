I recently had the opportunity to invest in a venture capital
fund. In this post, I want to explain how these funds work and
what I've learned from the experience to far.

*Disclaimer:* The information in this post is based on my limited
experience and personal research. I've done my best to
be correct, but I'm not an expert in the space; please let me know
if anything here is glaringly wrong and I'll correct it.

## Intro to venture capital

Venture capital (VC) is a common form of private market financing
for tech startups. Nearly every major, big-name tech company founded
in the last 30 years, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, got
VC money when they were smaller.

The VC space is populated by a number of large and very famous
firms including [Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/) and
[Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/). But, the barriers to
entry aren't that huge, and there's also a long tail of less well-known
firms, even going down to small, mom-and-pop shops like the one
that I invested with (more on that later).

These *firms* manage one or more *funds*. The funds are what investors
actually invest in, not the firms. By analogy to more traditional
investments, the firms are the equivalent of Vanguard or Fidelity,
and the funds are things like Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index
Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/fees/vtsax)).

As a VC investor, the funds are what you're primarily interacting with,
so let's dig more into how those work.

### All about funds

More formally, a venture capital fund is the legal entity that
collects investor money, writes checks to startups in exchange for
equity (ownership) stakes, and distributes the profits (minus any
expenses and fees) back to the investors when these companies are
acquired or go public.

A large VC firm might have dozens of funds active at any given time.
Sequoia, for instance, has ones like the
[Sequoia Capital China Growth Fund V](https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/sequoia-capital-raised-sequoia-capital-china-growth-fund-v--1833fa51)
and
[Sequoia Capital U.S. Growth Partners Fund VIII](https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/sequoia-capital-raised-sequoia-capital-u-s--growth-viii-principals-fund--a2ebdeae).
Note that fund names are often suffixed in Roman numerals-
we'll talk about why in a bit.

Just as with more traditional mutual funds, VC funds typically have
some sort of specialization that drives the investments- these can
include specific types of companies (e.g., healthcare), company stages,
or geographies.

Unlike mutual funds, however, VC funds have a number of unique
characteristics that make them quite exotic and complex
from the investor perspective. These are discussed in the
sections below.

#### 1: Limited time frame

The first weird thing about venture capital funds is that
they usually have a limited time frame. Unlike a mutual fund that
lives for decades and has thousands of investors buying and selling
shares every day, traditional venture capital funds are very restricted
on when money comes in and when it gets paid out.

First, the fund gets commitments from investors. Once the target
amount is raised, it's closed to new investors and the fund managers
then spend the next few years talking to startups, signing deals,
and deploying the investors' money. At a certain point, new
investments stop and the fund is focused primarily on helping its
portfolio companies grow and achieve a liquidity event like an
acquisition or, more rarely, an IPO. When the latter happen, the
proceeds are distributed back to the investors.

After a fixed time period, traditionally ten years, the fund is
dissolved, and any remaining assets are liquidated and distributed
back to the investors.

Because of this lifecycle, investors have to be locked in for the entire
fund term. You can't sell your stake and get out after five years,
for instance, because you've changed your mind or need the money for
something else.

Another side effect of these fund schedules is that if a VC firm wants
to be continuously collecting investor money and investing in companies,
it needs to be constantly creating new funds. So, a firm will create
"US Growth Fund I", then, a year or two later "US Growth Fund II",
and so forth. If a firm has a long streak of successful investments,
the Roman numeral suffixes can get quite big.

#### 2: Investor restrictions

Another big difference with traditional investments is that not everyone
is eligible to invest in a VC fund. First,
you generally need to be an
[accredited investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp). In the US specifically, that means that you
either need an income of at least $200k per year or a net worth of at
least $1M.

Even if you have a lot of money, though, it might not be enough. Large
funds often have minimum investment thresholds in the millions of
dollars, putting them out of reach to everyone but the super rich or
institutional investors like pension funds.

There are yet more barriers- even if you're super rich, funds might not
want to take your money; they could already have more than they can
deploy or their legal structure (below) might restrict the total
number of investors.

#### 3: Solicitation restrictions

Most VC funds are legally not allowed to do "general solicitation"
of investors. This is why if you go to the website of a VC firm like
[Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/), there's no big, red
"Open an account now!!" button, or even any basic information
about contacting them to learn more about investing.
Likewise, no matter how wealthy you are, you won't get any
unsolicited emails or mailings about VC fund opportunities.

The fund managers can only solicit you if there's a "pre-existing"
relationship, e.g. you're a friend or former work colleague. So, it's hard
to find opportunities unless you have connections in the VC
community.

#### 4: Partnership structure

Yet another weird feature of VC funds is that they're usually
structured as *partnerships*. When you put money in, you become
a limited partner

#### 5: Fee structure

Finally, VC funds have much higher fees than traditional investments.
The typical structure is the so called "two and twenty"- 2% per year of the
total amount you've committed, plus 20% of any profits.

Thus, the fund needs to have pretty solid returns for investors to get
their money back. And, if the fund happens to get lucky and invest in the
next Google or Facebook, they'll be raking in a massive amount of money from
their investors' profits.

## The process so far

#### 1: Solicitation

Late last year, I got an email from some friends from college that I
hadn't been in touch with for a very long time. They were starting a
venture capital fund and were wondering if I was possibly interested in
investing. I replied with something along the lines of "tell me more", and we
went on from there.

#### 2: The pitch

The next step was to hear their pitch. I met with them on Zoom, and they
gave me a short presentation on their investment thesis (putting money
into early stage companies run by experienced founders) and how
the logistics would work if I signed up. Because their fund was
really small and because most of their investors

#### 3: Signing the paperwork

After hearing the pitch, I decided to put some money in.

#### 4: First capital call



#### 5: First investments

#### 6: Tax time

#### 7: Profit?
