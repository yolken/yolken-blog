I recently had the opportunity to invest in a venture capital
fund. In this post, I want to explain how these funds work and
what I've learned from the experience to far.

*Disclaimer:* The information in this post is based on my limited
experience and personal research. I've done my best to
be correct, but I'm not an expert in the space; please let me know
if anything here is glaringly wrong and I'll correct it.

## Intro to venture capital

Venture capital (VC) is a common form of private market financing
for tech startups. Nearly every major, big-name tech company founded
in the last 30 years, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, got
VC money when they were smaller.

The VC space is populated by a number of large and very famous
firms including [Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/) and
[Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/). But, the barriers to
entry aren't that huge, and there's also a long tail of less well-known
firms, even going down to small, mom-and-pop shops like the one
that I invested with (more on that later).

These *firms* manage one or more *funds*. The funds are what investors
actually invest in, not the firms. By analogy to more traditional
investments, the firms are the equivalent of Vanguard or Fidelity,
and the funds are things like Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index
Fund ([VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/fees/vtsax)).

As a VC investor, the funds are what you're primarily interacting with,
so let's dig more into how those work.

### All about funds

More formally, a venture capital fund is the legal entity that
collects investor money, writes checks to startups in exchange for
equity (ownership) stakes, and distributes the profits (minus any
expenses and fees) back to the investors when these companies are
acquired or go public.

A large VC firm might have dozens of funds active at any given time.
Sequoia, for instance, has ones like the
[Sequoia Capital China Growth Fund V](https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/sequoia-capital-raised-sequoia-capital-china-growth-fund-v--1833fa51)
and
[Sequoia Capital U.S. Growth Partners Fund VIII](https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/sequoia-capital-raised-sequoia-capital-u-s--growth-viii-principals-fund--a2ebdeae).
Note that fund names are often suffixed in Roman numerals-
we'll talk about why in a bit.

Just as with more traditional mutual funds, VC funds typically have
some sort of specialization that drives the investments- these can
include specific types of companies (e.g., healthcare), company stages,
or geographies.

Unlike mutual funds, however, VC funds have a number of unique
characteristics that make them quite exotic and complex
from the investor perspective. These are discussed in the
sections below.

#### Limited time frame

#### Investor restrictions

VC funds have a lot of restrictions on who can invest. First,
you generally need to be an
[accredited investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp), meaning that you either need an income
of at least $200k per year or a net worth of at least $1M.

Even if you have a lot of money, it might not be enough. Large
funds might require millions of dollars
