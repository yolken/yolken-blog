            </div>At many companies the "senior engineer" level is fairly straightforward to get into, but hard to
get promoted beyond. The difficulty in advancing past "senior" can cause a lot of frustration and
make people feel stuck in their careers. In this post, I want to share some observations about this "senior engineer plateau", why it causes frustration, and how to navigate out of it.

there are certain traits that show up on the personality side that can be genuinely counterproductive to my team's work. In this post, I want to explain what these are and how I
try to deal with them.

how companies can make their onboarding processes better.

I decided to leave academia after graduation. At the time, I explored several career choices
but ultimately decided to take a Product Manager job at Google. In this post, I want to discuss
why I think tech is a great destination for people with technical PhDs.

In this post, I want to describe how the different kinds of equity work and why I strongly
prefer one type, restricted stock units (RSUs), over options-based alternatives.

            </div>Most tech companies, even those without formal job titles,
assign "levels" to engineers. Despite the importance of levels for determining compensation
and job expectations, many companies prevent non-management employees
from seeing anyone's levels besides their own. In this post,
I explain why this is a harmful practice that should be
discontinued.
